# Maldev
Work done relating to Maldev Academy Coursework
The intention is to build a CLI tool that can be used to help in the creation of malware samples
Functions that would be useful for this project are:
- Payload encryption [XOR/RC4/AESXXX]
- Payload obfuscation [MAC/UUID/IPv4/IPv6]
- Payload encoding [ROT13/BASE64/HEX/UTF8]
